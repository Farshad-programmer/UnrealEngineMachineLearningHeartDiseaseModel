*** Very Important***


In the helper.py file, the variables input_file_path, output_file_path_result, and output_file_path_modelAccuracy must be edited according to the file paths on your computer.
Additionally, in the main.cpp file, within the RunPythonScript, SendPatientInformation, and FinalResultFromPython functions, any file paths must be updated with the correct paths on your computer.
Otherwise, the project will not work. If you encounter any issues, please email me at Farshad.christ@gmail.com for assistance.
